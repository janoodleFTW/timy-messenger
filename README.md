# Project Structure

This is a Flutter mobile app targeting Android and iOS.

The code for the Flutter app is contained in the folder `lib` and the
different native apps are in `android` and `ios`. Extra project assets are in
`assets` and `fonts`.

As well, this repo hosts a series of Firebase config files and cloud functions.

The documentation for Firebase part is inside the `firebase` folder.


# Prerequisites & Getting Started
## Client 

To build and run the mobile apps you‚Äôll need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and its dependencies. To verify your installation run in the project‚Äôs root directory:**‚Äå**

```
$ flutter doctor
```

The app is optimized for Android and iOS phones in portrait mode.

**Note:** Additionally you‚Äôll need to add the GoogleService-Info of your Firebase app to your clients as described in `B3. Configure firebase app` below.


## Backend (Firebase)

The backend is build using Firebase‚Äôs `node.js` SDK. All files are provided in the `firebase` folder. To deploy the code create an app and install the firebase CLI (See steps 1 & 2 in [Getting started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)).

*Note: The following steps assume you‚Äôre using Firebases‚Äô free `Spark Plan`. Therefore we‚Äôre performing the configuration manually.*

### B1. Setup sign-in method & adding users

An initial sign-in method needs to be configured.

- Select your project in [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com). 
- Navigate to `Authentication` 
- Select `Sign-in methods` and activate `Email / Password`.


**Adding a user**

Currently, users need to be added *manually*.  

- In firebase navigate to `Authentication` and select `Users`. 
- Then `Add user`. 

Please copy the `User-UID` of the created user. We‚Äôll need to add this ID to a group in the next step.

*Note: You‚Äôll need to have at least one user configured to use the app.*


### B2. Create and setup database
In the firebase console select `Database` under `Develop`  and create a Cloud Firestore Database in region `eur3 (europe-west)`.

*Note: To use the app you‚Äôll need to create a group. A ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù is similar to e.g. a ‚ÄúTeam‚Äù in Slack. To create one:* 


**Create group collection**

- Select the database you‚Äôve just created.
- `Create collection` and name it `groups`.\
- Add your first group with the following properties:

| name | type | value |
|:--|:--|:--|
| abbreviation | string | TE |
| color | string | ffffff |
| members | array | *User-UID we‚Äôve retrieved in **Adding a user*** above |
| name | string | test |

We‚Äôve now setup our fist test group. In addition to this step, we‚Äôll need to setup a default `Channel` (e.g. something similar to `#general` in Slack).


**Create channel sub-collection**

- In the `groups` collection select the newly created group.  
- `Create collection` within the group called `channels`.
- Add your first channel with the following properties:

| name | type | value |
|:--|:--|:--|
| name | string | general |
| type | string | TOPIC |
| visibility | string | OPEN |


### B3. Configure firebase app
Next, you‚Äôll need to configure your firebase app for Flutter as described in [Add Firebase to an App / Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)


**iOS**

- Enter iOS-Bundle-ID: `de.janoodle.circlesApp.debug`
- Download and rename `GoogleService-Info.plist` to  `GoogleService-Info-Dev.plist`.
- Copy file to `ios/Runner/Firebase`.

*NOTE: If you‚Äôre building for release you‚Äôll additionally need to add a GoogleService-Info-Prod.plist pointing to your production Firebase app.*
	
	
### B4. Deploy firebase functions 

Navigate to the `firebase` directory and deploy all functions using:

```
$ firebase deploy --only functions
```


### B5. Final steps

Run the flutter app using your favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code / Android Studio). Next, you‚Äôll need to run the app. 

*Note: Please skip any error that might occur.* 

Login with the user you‚Äôve created above. 
Next create your first `event` to setup the *calendar collection* in our backend. 


**Create an event**

- In the app select the hamburger menu
- Hit the `+` sign next to `Events`
- Enter any data you like and hit `Create` 

At the root level of your database you should now see a collection called `calendar` in your firebase console.

Now we‚Äôre ready to deploy all parts of our backend using:

```
$ firebase deploy
```


# Deployment

The app is setup to work with a development and production environment. We suggest you create a different Firebase app for each environment. 

When building for release the app will automatically use the production configuration that you‚Äôve configured in step `B3`.

# About

The concept for Timy was created and developed by [kaalita](https://github.com/kaalita) and [philippmoeser](https://github.com/philippmoeser).
The initial version is a MVP messaging app focusing on organizing events among groups.

We hope this project can be a reference or building block for your next flutter app. üöÄ
