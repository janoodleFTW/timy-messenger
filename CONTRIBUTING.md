# Contributing to Timy Messenger

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a guideline for contributing to Timy Messenger. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, 
and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Expectation vs Reality

Timy Messenger is an open source app created originally
by Janoodle Unlimited GmbH as part of an Minimum Viable Product test.
It is currently Open Source and available for you to use, change and play with.

However, **this project is no longer under development**,
which means that there's no plan to add new features to it.
The original developers are still maintainers of the project and will keep an eye on it, but don't expect quick responses.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you notice something not working, feel free to report a bug using the "Report Bug" template.

**All bugs reported that don't follow the template will be marked as 'invalid' and closed.**

### Adding Documentation

Any sort of documentation is welcome.

For example:

- Setup instructions.
- Documenting methods with useful comments.
- Links to external resources like blog posts or videos talking about the app.

### Providing Translations

We are happy to add more translations to the app.

### Fixing Reported Bugs

We are happy to add any fixes to the reported bugs in "Issues".
